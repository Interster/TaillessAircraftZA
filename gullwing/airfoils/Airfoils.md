# Airfoil choice for low speed tailless aircraft

A whole universe of airfoils exist for the use of the aircraft designer.  The application of the specific aircraft will help narrow down the number of choices, but there will still be many options that would be potential candidates for a low speed tailless aircraft.  The following characteristics are most desirable for tailless sailplane aircraft operating in the low speed (below 200 kph) region.

- Low pitching moment coefficient as displayed by reflexed airfoils.  This is very desirable since it would lead to lower trim moments.

- Laminar flow over the largest section of chord possible, leading to low drag.  Reflexed laminar flow profiles only really started appearing in the late 70s and early 80s with the advent of computer panel methods.

- High lift.

- A high stall angle.



Here are some possible candidates.  Some are good for benchmarking numerical tools and some are known to have been used on tailless aircraft before.



NACA 23012 - This is a low pitching moment profile used on helicopter blades.  Its drag characteristics are probably not that favourable, but there is a lot of windtunnel data available on this airfoil, making it good for benchmarking purposes.

NACA 0012 - This symmetrical airfoil has zero pitching moment, but is not optimal with respect to drag.  There is a lot of data available on this airfoil.

CM180 - Similar to what is used on the Flair 30 aircraft.  High lift and relatively low pitching moment.

HQ36 - Used on the SB13 aircraft.  Reflexed laminar flow profile.

HQ34 - Used on the SB13 aircraft.  Reflexed laminar flow profile.

Eppler profiles - There are a number of Eppler profiles with reflex that could be suitable candidates.

Prandtl wing profiles - Used on the Prandtl D aircraft.
